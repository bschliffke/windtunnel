Future development should include a parallel set of function for measurements done in non-coincidence mode. Also a new branch for
a quick basic analysis of concentration measurements would be useful. Some open TODOs can be found in windtunnel_playground.py. 
Any functions developed by single users outside of this package, but are considered useful to the user base of the windtunnel
package, may be added. At this point the python PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code 
(https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#code-lay-out) has to be followed to maintain readability and consistency within the
package's source code. All maintenance work has to be documented with reasons given for the work done. After any work has been
completed the documentation must be updated to reflect the packages current state.
